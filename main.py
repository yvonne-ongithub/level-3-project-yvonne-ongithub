"""
The following is a list of topics that were covered in class, as described in Canvas.
It also describes how the topics were used in the program.

Input - Input the user's choice of categories and letters
Math -  Add special items to the list, like money based on length of puzzle.
Output - Display fun things on the screen to increase the feel of the game show experience
Variable - Store user guesses 
DataCamp - Python Logic, Control Flow and Filtering
Elif - Work through the user's puzzle guesses
For Loop - Fill in the blanks on the screen
Functions -  Random number generator, file handling, screen displays
If Else - Select consonants or select vowels
Lists - Store the choices for the puzzle categories
While - While the user has not completed guessing the puzzle answer and has not run out of guesses
CSV Files - Read in the choices for each puzzle category and store them in lists

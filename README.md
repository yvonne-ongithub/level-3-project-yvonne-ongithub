# Objective
What does the project do? Why is it useful or relevant?

There are two levels to this project.

### Develop a product that is useful, recognizable, and fun.
* The recognizability is in the title of the project and in the project description.
* As for being useful, there are a number of schools of thought on the meaning and usefulness of games. However, exploring that perspective is a non-goal for the project.
* Fun - most games are fun.  Exploration is fun. Games may make the user think that debugging is fun.

### Demonstrate all of the competencies acquired as a result of being a student in this class (and then some).

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project is similar to the bonus round of the famous game show.  Contestants will select a category and then "spin" the wheel for a random and secret prize.

The blanks that represent the puzzle are displayed on the screen, and then the letters "NSTLRE" are filled in, if present.

The contestant guesses 3 consonants and a vowel, and then is given the opportunity to solve the puzzle. Instead of being given 10 seconds to solve, however, the contestant is given 5 tries to type in the correct answer. If they guess correctly, the game will reward them with congratulatory images and messages.  If they do not guess the puzzle in the expected number of tries, the game will display non-congratulatory images and messages, along with the answer to the puzzle.

The user is given the opportunity to play the bonus round again, whereupon the game re-sets itself with another prize and another puzzle.

## COMPETENCIES
The competencies acquired are from every homework assignment from this class.
I am also including the random number generator and some basic string manipulation as described in w3schools.org/python.
This list of competencies is inherently pseudocode, and will be copied into the actual code as appropriate.  Note that the order in which the competencies are in this list may not be the order in which they are demonstrated in the code.
They are as follows:

DataCamp - Python Basics
Input - input the user's choice of categories and letters
Math -  add special items to the list, like money based on length of puzzle.
Output - Display fun things on the screen to increase the feel of the game show experience
Variable - Store user guesses 
DataCamp - Python Logic, Control Flow and Filtering
Elif - work through the user's puzzle guesses
For Loop - fill in the blanks on the screen
Functions -  random number generator, file handling, screen displays
If Else - select consonants or select vowels
Lists - store the choices for the puzzle categories
While - while the user has not completed guessing the puzzle answer and has not run out of guesses
CSV Files - read in the choices for each puzzle category and store them in lists

The plan that guides the implementation is to follow the above specification until the code is complete and fully debugged.
